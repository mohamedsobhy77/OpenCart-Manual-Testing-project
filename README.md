# 🛒 OpenCart Manual Testing

This repository contains detailed manual testing documentation for the OpenCart e-commerce platform. The purpose of this project is to apply and showcase my manual testing skills through a real-world web application.

🎯 Objective :
To simulate a real-world QA project using OpenCart’s demo site, design comprehensive test cases across major modules, report bugs with severity classification, and document the entire manual testing workflow using Excel and GitHub. This project helps demonstrate practical, job-ready QA skills.

## My Role in the Project

As a QA enthusiast, I independently designed and executed manual testing for the OpenCart platform. I was responsible for:

- Analyzing the application's features and user flows.
- Designing test scenarios and writing detailed test cases in Excel.
- Executing tests across various flows and recording actual outcomes.
- Identifying and reporting bugs with proper severity classification.
- Organizing and uploading all documentation to GitHub for public review.

This hands-on testing effort was done as part of my QA learning journey and to demonstrate practical, job-ready skills.

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced

- Initially, I struggled to apply proper testing techniques (like boundary value, equivalence partitioning) while designing test cases.
- Creating effective and varied test data sets was confusing at first, especially for input validation scenarios.
- Understanding complex e-commerce flows like checkout and wishlist management required time and exploration.
- Classifying bugs by severity and priority without real-time team discussions helped me learn independent judgment.
- Structuring all documentation in a clean, organized format took iteration and attention to detail.

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Developed a strong foundation in manual testing processes and techniques.
- Improved in writing test cases using real-world flows and various validation methods.
- Practiced independent testing and judgment while simulating a real QA workflow.
- Understood how to track, prioritize, and report bugs with clarity and structure.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Automate critical user flows (Login, Register, Checkout) using Selenium WebDriver.
- Integrate JIRA-style bug reporting format for better traceability.
- Test across different browsers and devices using tools like BrowserStack.
